            <h2>Old Dog, New Tricks</h2>

            <article>They say old dogs can't learn new tricks. What I want to know is, who the hell even are they?</article>

            <article>Being introduced and falling in love with sports is a bittersweet venture. One never believes for a second that their passion could die or, even trying to picture themselves doing something else can be an impossible and unfathomable task.</article>

            <article>Unfortunately, there comes a time in most sports enthusiast's lives when enough is enough and it's time to call it a day. Generally it's the person's body that can no longer perform at the required level or worse at any level.</article>

            <article>Marco (44) was a professional soccer player in Portugal. Throughout his life he didn't have much time for other hobbies. Training for soccer was always a priority. He held an extensive career, and when it was over, he didn't know where to turn.</article>

            <article>Now faced with a lot of free time, he spent his evenings walking his dog Max (10) along the beach near their home. Every evening they would walk to a particular bench and rest, watching the surfers catch waves in the distance. </article>

            <article>Marco had never surfed, and one day he decided it was something he wanted to try. One morning on a beach in Portugal he plucked up the courage and went to a surf shop to rent a board and a wetsuit. </article>

            <article>He quickly realised that he had a big problem on his hands. As soon as he touched the water, Max would let out a yelp and run to his aid.
                He had a choice to make. Lock Max up at home or let him try too.</article>
 
            <article>This picture is taken 2 years on. Marco and Max are now the highlight of every person who visits their local beach.</article>

            <article>It may be 'just a proverb' but, you're never too old to learn anything if you really want to and you can teach old dogs new tricks...</article>
